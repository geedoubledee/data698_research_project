I think I can help. Start by opening and unrolling the crescent roll dough. You will have two rectangles of dough that are scored into triangles. Place the first rectangle of dough on your cookie sheet so that it is taller than wide. This will be the base for your yummy fillings. Divide the second piece of dough along the scored lines to form triangles as if you were rolling them for crescent rolls. Position the triangles along the long sides of the rectangle that serves as your base. You will line them up with the short side of triangle slightly over the dough of the base. The opposite angle should stick out like a baseball pennant/flag. (To help you imagine this: When this is done, your rectangle of dough might look like a saw with teeth coming out of each side.) This should yield about 4-6 flags flying off the center base on each side. Press the dough together to hold. Line your fillings on the center base rectangle. Now, fold each triangle into the center, pulling the dough across the filling and slightly down to meet the rectangle base on the opposite side. Triangles on opposite sides of your base should overlap or criss-cross each other as you fold. (Visual: Think of how a corset's straps overlap. Or shoelaces.)

For me, in trying to eat a bit healthier this is a good ""not from scratch but maybe better for us than fast food"" recipe. You can make it even easier -use chunky salsa of your choice in place of these three ingredients - can of tomatoes, can of green chilis and chopped cilantro. We used low sodium cream of chicken soup and reduced fat cheese. The recipe makes a lot of 'sauce' ... next time I may double the number of tortillas to make more enchiladas, up the amount of chicken & veggies in the filling ... and maybe even add black beans if the family agrees. I think with those additions the ratio of sauce to enchilad will be more to our preference. We had a salad with ours, but next time I think I'll just shred lettuce and dice some tomatoes and serve on top of the entree for some freshness.",820.0,2.0

A couple of modifications -- the main being that I substitute sage for basil. I'm not sure why basil would be in a Southern style stuffing instead of sage, so that substitution changes everything. I also did not use sour cream but made a non sweet cornbread without it, but definitely with the cream-style corn. This is not necessary, but I believe makes it better, but I use equal parts day-old French bread along with the corn bread which cuts down on some of the sweetness also. I also did not use celery or cayenne pepper, a personal preference, and I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian.

I have used this recipe as a starting point for many, many years and my dressing always turns out different depending on what ingredients I add, but my guests always rave about it. The oysters are really the key here - do not leave them out! Most of my guests have no idea the dish contains oysters until I tell them. Fresh are obviously better than canned, but they require much more work. You should chop up the oysters so each bite has the same consistency. I increase the onion and celery and add diced red & green bell pepper, minced garlic, and chopped mushroom. I saute the veggies around in some olive oil, S&P until they start to soften and release their natural flavors, before dumping them in with the cornbread mixture. You can toss in some day-old or staling bread into your mixture. Crushed croutons and seasoned breadcrumbs work, too. You can use whatever spices you like, even add cayenne pepper or a few shakes of Tabasco if you like some heat. Add chopped green onions (do not saute) and then dump the entire mixture into the casserole dish and pour about 18-24 oz of chicken broth over the top and let sit at least a day, preferably two, before baking.

I made a number of modifications that I think improved the flavor and reduced the cooking time (TLDR: added garlic powder, dill, a little salt, cracked pepper; only 1 cup heavy cream; finished cooking the pasta in the sauce for a few minutes at the end). Full instructions: I used a big pot to boil a full package of penne, which I undercooked by about 2-3 minutes (still just a little hard in the middle). I put it in the colander to drain and then used the same pot to heat some olive oil, brown the chopped onion, and added the wine/chicken broth. At this stage, I also added a little salt, dill, garlic powder, cracked pepper to give it some extra flavor. I boiled/reduced about 1/4 of it (~10-15 min), then added the flaked smoked salmon, followed by 1 cup heavy cream (you can add more, I wanted it on the lighter side). Once this was boiling, I put the pasta back in and cooked the pasta in the sauce so it absorbed some of the flavor for a few minutes.

As for too much salt, the problem the other reviewer probably had is she used table salt when the recipe calls for kosher salt. The difference in that would be profound. Also, some broths are naturally salty and you have to take that into account. The bird itself may add some salt, depending on how you cooked it. Either way, you should know how salty you like things, and so it's wrong to put a one-star review on a dish you messed up. Fixing it with lemon juice is pointless. Add more (salt-free) broth, more rice. It would even out some. Anyway, if you hate cilantro, like me, parsley works fine here. As do red or green bell peppers if you dislike heat.

Comparing it to my other scone recipes, I knew right away that that wasn’t going to be enough liquid so I upped the eggnog to one cup and it was perfect. I also know that you don’t want to mess around with “kneading“ scone dough as it will make them tough. At the most, I will fold it two or three times just to make sure it’s all together. I rolled it out slightly more than 1/2 inch and then cut with my small triangle cutter. Then I put them on a parchment lined cookie sheet and stuck them in the freezer for 15 minutes. I do this for all my scones to keep them from spreading out too much. These took 22 minutes to bake and that gave them a just golden bottom with a hint of brown on the top. Based on comments that there wasn’t much of an eggnog flavor, I made a glaze with 3/4 of a cup powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of the eggnog and then just brushed it on top of the cooled scones. All I had was a medium grind cornmeal, and I don’t like the grit that I get in the bites. Perhaps next time I’ll try it with a fine ground cornmeal. It does have an interesting texture but it’s not too far off British scones. If you’re used to American scones, however, you may not like this. I call American scones cookie cakes.

I work as a cook at a local summer camp, and we were looking for a way to use up leftover scalloped potatoes-which we usually have a lot of because you don't exactly know how much a group will eat! :) The recipe was easy to multiply, simple enough to make for a group of 20 or more, and had on hand or easily purchased items. The campers (various ages) seem to like it as well. :)I was also able to make it vegetarian easily by using vegetable broth and no ham. The first time I made it, I used leftover ham from dinner (yay no food waste!) and the leftover water the meat was cooked in. The water absorbed all the lovely ham juices, so it gave a good savory flavor to the soup. It was a little bit salty but not too bad.I do have a question hopefully this format will let you answer? :) We serve our food on a steam table (buffet style), so it is continuously warmed by hot water, and I also cook it longer to get to the 165 degree food safety standard. I've made it twice in the last month or so, and both times it's turned out very thick- about the consistency of mashed potatoes.

I cut the volume of the brine and made it with 2C milk, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, and Hot sauce. Marinated drumsticks in fridge for 3 hours. The coating I made as directed, and the dredge was more than enough to coat all the drumsticks with excess. I had to cook the legs longer than recommended, since I didn’t use breasts. I coated (sprayed) the legs as indicated with the olive oil cooking spray, and I baked the legs 30 min per side, flipping once, due to the amount of legs I cooked and the fact that it’s dark meat. I wanted no blood near the bone. Total cooking time was 1 hour at 350. For the sauce, I made that exactly as the directions, but the sugar seized and clumped in the mixture due to the heat, so I added 2 Tbsp of water and that allowed the seized sugar to unclump, and I was able to use a basting brush to lightly coat the cooked drumsticks as they came out of the oven.

Now, I notice many people mention their eggs come out dry. Here are some techniques for obtaining fluffy scrambled eggs. First, keep in mind that fluffiness in eggs depend on the addition of either water or milk. Note: Milk works better in scrambled eggs and water works better in omelets. Second, once you crack the eggs open, beat them slightly. Third, once you pour the eggs in the pan, let it set for 30 seconds. Adjust your heat to medium low to cook them slowly and prevent quick browning. Also use more than a tsp of butter. This will help you to scramble them more easily without having to over beat the eggs. I usually use 1 tbsp. to make scrambled eggs.

And I can tell you that to my surprise, this was REALLY good. The only thing that I will do differently in the future is add quite a bit more spinach, and not saute it at the start with the mushrooms and garlic. It wilts very quickly, so by the time the mushrooms are cooked, you’re starting to get concerned that it’s going to burn. Also, might cut back just a bit on the paprika (just personal preference here). Probably will cook garlic and mushrooms for several minutes and then add in the spinach. What’s really interesting to me is what an important role the tomatoes play. It’s a totally different texture than the rest of this recipe, and that little punch of juiciness and sweetness works flawlessly. SissyAnn, thank you for a very nice lunch today.

While it comes seasoned, I still used all of the spices in the recipe. I made the rice and when done put in a large Pyrex bowl. Then I added the sautéed onions, garlic, peppers, and spices to it. To that I added the fresh corn, canned black beans, and fresh Roma tomatoes. I also used half of a lime. I only seasoned the sauté mix with salt as rice already had salt from the seasoning in the box mix. As I needed the achiote flavor to come through I sprinkled a bit more on top and mixed.

Yum! I made this almost exactly as written and it was delicious! Proportion of ingredients is spot on. I have frequently made Taco Seasoning I (see Cook’s Note on this recipe), but tonight I used a taco seasoning blend that I sell, which worked very well using the measurements in the recipe.

My 1 can yielded very close to 2 cups with juices and was the perfect amount in this recipe. I was out of elbow noodles and subbed with 2 cups Gluten Free (GF) Rotini pasta. All pasta varies in cooking time so be careful if you end up subbing as I did due to dietary restrictions and being out of GF elbow/macaroni. My rule of thumb with IP pasta for cook time is to take the lowest cook time listed on the package (subtract 1 minute if necessary to get to an even number, then divide in half, and subtract 2 minutes. So for Barilla GF Rotini, 8 min/2 = 4 and minus 2 minutes = 2. I set the timer for 2 minutes and had perfectly cooked pasta).

This recipe was a big hit in our house — packed with veggies and tender chicken, hearty and cozy, but still light and healthy-feeling. I did make a few changes to the recipe to both streamline it and use what I had on hand.First, I used about ⅓ of a butternut squash since I didn’t have calabaza. I measured out a pound of cubed butternut, putting the rest up for another dish. I also didn’t have a whole tomato — it’s still winter where I am and the tomatoes aren’t great. Instead, I swapped in a 14-oz can of cherry tomatoes in their own sauce, then added about 2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste in place of another can of tomato sauce to prevent it from being too watery. We didn’t have canned corn, so I used the last of a bag of frozen corn. I also swapped out some of the salt in favor of Maggi seasoning for a little hit of MSG goodness.Second, I changed the method to be a 1-pot recipe. I sprinkled the chicken thighs with about ⅓ of the kosher salt and browned them in my Dutch oven. After browning (before they were fully cooked), I chopped them and set them and their juices aside. I then proceeded to sauté the veggies as instructed but added another ⅓ of the salt to help encourage sweating. I then added the chopped chicken and the spices to the pot, stirring to coat everything in the spice. Finally, I added the canned tomatoes/juice, used 2 cups of hot water to slosh out the last bit of tomato-ey goodness from the can, stirred in some tomato paste, and simmered. Rather than seasoning the pot with salt at the end, I used the Maggi seasoning to adjust.To serve, I sprinkled on fresh cilantro and a few glugs of Cholula. Absolutely delicious! Next time, I might add in a chopped jalapeño or two for added spice, a few teaspoons of Mexican oregano, and simmer the stew with a bay leaf for a little added heat and complexity.

There were some minor changes made from the way this recipe was submitted, so I’d like to add that this is best served immediately “hot.” Once you have the sauce consistency to your liking, it’s even best to remove the inner pot, so that the residual heat from the Instant Pot® will not continue to cook the mac and cheese.

As far as the “30 minute” saute in the video, if my memory is correct, I think when you first hit the Saute button, it defaults to 30 minutes, and then you make your adjustment in time.

I adjusted the quantities of the veggies in the recipe to 1 c. of celery, 1 c. of cucumber, 4 small tomatoes (which I seeded) and 5 TBS of shallots. I would recommend Farfalle (bow tie) pasta instead of shells and I used more like 12 oz. Shells just seems to trap dressing which can be good or bad depending on your sensibilities. I adjusted the dressing too by adding a TBS of Worchestershire sauce and more dill but quantity wise there was plenty of dressing even with the increases in veggies and pasta.

Although the only downfall is that it doesn't keep in the refrigerator very long, I probably wouldn't eat it more than 4 to 6 days after making it and it does need to be refrigerated unlike some butter or margarine there's no preservatives in this other than what comes in the whipping cream therefore definitely refrigerate it.
